Overview of the Project

Project: Create tool for PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER 

Objective:-
The objective of the Password Strength Checker project is to build a tool that checks the strength of passwords based on factors like length, complexity, and uniqueness. 
The tool will provide a score to show how secure the password is and give feedback to users. It will check for different character types, such as uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and 
special characters, and compare the password against common ones to avoid weak choices. The goal is to help users create stronger and more secure passwords with helpful suggestions.

Key Activities:-
1. Password Evaluation and Scoring: Analyze the password's length, character types, and uniqueness to assign a security score.
 
2. Common Password Check: Compare the entered password with a list of commonly used passwords to flag weak choices.
 
3. Complexity Assessment: Evaluate the inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters to determine password strength.
 
4. Uniqueness Check: Assess the password for repeated characters or patterns to ensure it's unique and not easily guessable.
 
5. User Feedback and Suggestions: Provide clear feedback and actionable tips to users for improving their password strength based on the score.

Technologies Used:-
1. Python: The primary language used for implementing the password strength checker, allowing efficient string manipulation and logic handling.

2. string Module (Python): Provides easy access to character sets (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters) to evaluate password complexity.

3. Conditional Statements and Loops (Python): Used to evaluate password properties like length, character variety, and uniqueness, and calculate the strength score.

4. Input/Output (Python): Manages user input for the password and displays feedback based on the passwordâ€™s strength.

Key Insights:-
Stronger passwords make your security better. Longer passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols are harder to guess. Common passwords should be avoided because 
they are easy to crack. The more variety in your password (like using both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols), the harder it is to guess. Unique passwords, 
without repeated characters, are also safer. Finally, giving users feedback helps them understand how to create stronger passwords, improving overall security.
